# crbulktexturegen

Cosmic Reach bulk texture generator - can be used to mod blocks with JSON mods into the game quickly

## Instructions

Add the textures you want to add into the game into the "textures" folder in the same directory as the program. The textures have to be 16x16 in PNG format. This folder will be autogenerated upon running the software if it doesn't exist. Afterwards, run this program and the textures should be modded in into CR.

## OS compatibilty

The program has been tested on Windows (7 and up tested but older versions may work) and Linux (tested Debian but should work on any distro). Tested on Python 3.8 and up however older versions may work.
MacOS and other OS-es may have issues running this program as they are untested.
